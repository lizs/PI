#C# game server framework(based on [socket4net](https://github.com/lizs/Socket4Net))

####Features

* Easy to use
* Distributed
* Automatic codes generation supported
* Configurable

####Framework
Pi consists of 3 parts:`Node`/`ECS`/`Editor`
#####Node
Your server cluster may have multiple processes to work together, every process can perform as a server or an client or both.In pi, We call a server or an client as a `Node`. So, one process may have serveral `Nodes`, they are managed by `NodesMgr`. <br>

`Node` can communicate with others(remote) by a set of `Push/RequestAsyn` interfaces. `Node` and `NodesMgr` has their own configuration(standard xml), for example:
```xml
  <!--single node-->
  <node name="Chat server"
    type="Chat"
    guid="{12B3E06E-6CFF-4BC8-8DF9-67F03273C299}"
    ip="127.0.0.1"
    port="6001"
    pwd="">
  </node>
  
  <!--multiple server nodes-->
  <servers>
    <node .../>
    ...
  </servers>
  
  <!--multiple client nodes-->
  <clients>
    <node .../>
    ...
  </clients>
```
You can also config `Redis` nodes, for example:
```xml
  <redisnodes>
    <node name="Redis client"
    type="Redis"
    guid="{D49A172A-00DD-4E8D-AB21-490F35A560A2}"
    ip="127.0.0.1"
    port="6379"
    pwd="" />
  </redisnodes>
```

#####ECS
ECS is an Entity/Component/System implementation.

`Entity` indicates what data does an object have.  `Component` indicates what can an object do.<br>
`Entity` may has serveral `Component`, and it's codes could automatic generated by `Pi.Editor.exe`. `Component` is freedom, you can write the game driver logic in these `Components`.


#####Editor
It's main goal is to make `Entity` definition visually, but it's just a commandline tool in current development.
`Editor` generate `Pi.Gen.dll` finnally, which contains the game protocol, constants and entities.

######Protocol define
Standart google protobuf message.

######Entity define
Json file, for example:
```json
{
  "Comment": "实体定义",
  "Name": "Ship",
  "Properties": [
    "One",
    "Two",
    "Three"
  ],
  "Components": [
    "ModifierComponent",
  ]
}
```
